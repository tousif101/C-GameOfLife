[PLEASE MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?
	[e.g. does it crash, infinite loop when it should not, other?]
The status of my program is that the print works, but I could not implement
the interactive mode. 



How does your move algorithm work?
I have a struct of sad players and it has a sign, row and col. I compare 
the sadness of each place that does not have a '.' and if it is less 
than segregation rate, then I add it to the struct list. I then move the 
structs with the board spaces that are empty. 



============= SEGREGATION SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

Using a grid size of 10, what satisfaction, vacancy, and proportion percentages
did you find most revealing?
It splits the city in half, poor and rich, and the border is the 
vacancy spot. 



How well did your program illustrate and support the segregation theory?
My program did not do it to well, but if ran enough times it segregated 
enough.



How did this assignment change your views on segregation and social policy?
It shows how in real life that there is actual segregation and that 
no matter how hard we try to change it, it is in our nature to move 
towards people who are similar to us. This happens everywhere.



============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?
I leared that segration is always around and it happens. I learned how 
2-D arrays work. I learned how pointers worked. I did not learn 
that much to be honest. 



What was easy about this assignment?
It was not too easy, I struggled alot.



What gave you problems or troubles?
The interactive mode gave me the most problems. 



What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?
Not have an interactive mode to be honest. 



What would you have liked to do in this assignment?
Nothing much really.
